Yep! You're just one command away from locking in your work. Here's exactly what to type:

🟦 Step-by-Step: Commit Your Changes
Make sure you’re in the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd "C:\Users\elamb\OneDrive\Desktop\torchy demo"
Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
That stages all the changes.

Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Added animated sprite system and turn-based combat prototype"
That saves the change as a snapshot in your Git history.

Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push
That sends it up to GitHub so your homie can pull it down.

Let me know what happens or if it throws a message—we’re right at the "ship it" moment. 🚀

Perfect. Those warnings are totally normal—they’re just Git saying:

“Hey, I’ll convert line endings from Unix-style (LF) to Windows-style (CRLF) if needed later.”

You can ignore them completely.

✅ Now continue with the commit:
bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Added animated sprite system and turn-based combat prototype"
Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push
That will publish everything to your GitHub repo so your partner can pull it down and see the new magic in motion. Let me know how it goes!
